#part2
Its advisable to use n=0.015 for better results

I have already used normalization to solve part1 question1
i.e Xnew=(X-mean)/std_deviation
for calculation of weights

One could also do normalization of the results or use y=m*x+b(intercepts)
but I have used the same code as of part1_question1.
Please use the same submission for calculation in this part as well.

The last run of my code gave the accompanying file 'output.csv' as its result. Attaching for your consideration

NOTE: you may not achieve the same output.csv file as I have uploaded in my best solution, I did a lot of changes in the file and tried to come up with the least MAS value. 
Keeping that in mind, the final result would still be of the same order.

I would be happy to answer any problems if you may encounter any with my code.
