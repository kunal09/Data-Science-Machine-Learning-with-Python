#part1
#question1
For lr.py its advisable to use n=0.01 for better results

I have already used normalization to solve part1 question1
i.e Xnew=(X-mean)/std_deviation
for calculation of weights

#question2
The mean absolute error calculated is 626822.09745

#question3
check the p1_q3.pdf file attached for data and graphs

NOTE: you may not achieve the same output.csv file as I have uploaded in my best solution, I did a lot of changes in the file and tried to come up with the least MAS value. 
Keeping that in mind, the final result would still be of the same order.

I would be happy to answer any problems if you may encounter any with my code.
